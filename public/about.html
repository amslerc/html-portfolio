<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. Nice to meet you! With 2023 and me, I am learning many new things. 
I have had a fascination with languages and patterns, for a long time, 
most of which originates in my musical background. 
When I am working through a new piece in music, I love finding the patterns
and the code to "solve" the puzzle.</p>

<p>Studying Latin in high school gave me a good platform to launch into study of other languages as an adult.
  DuoLingo is currently my favorite way to learn vocabulary in these languages and my 
  most recent fascination is with Portuguese. 
</p>

<p>With my curiosity about musical and spoken languages, it has been a natural progression 
  to pursue technology related languages and I am excited to learn the "code"
  in this arena. In my experience, learning a new language stimulates enhanced thinking 
  and I look forward to seeing the future revelations of web development.
