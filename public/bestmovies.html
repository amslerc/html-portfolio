<h1>The Best Movies according to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>This is the best in the Star Wars series. The down ending seems to have only the faintest glimmer of hope for the Rebel Alliance.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A story of redemption, but it makes you wonder: "Did Andy DuFrain got away with murder?"</p>

<h3>Shoplifters</h3>
<p>A film about chosen family, but with a twist.</p>
